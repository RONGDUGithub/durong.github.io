# About Me

Hi, I’m **Rong DU**, a recent Ph.D. graduate from the **Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering** at **The Hong Kong Polytechnic University**.  

My research spans multiple cutting-edge areas, including **Security & Privacy**, **Blockchain**, and **Differential Privacy**. I am passionate about solving real-world challenges through advanced technologies and am currently seeking opportunities to contribute my expertise in academia or industry.

### Research Interests:
- **Data Science**: Data fusion, data integrity, high-dimensional/spatiotemporal data processing.
- **AI Security**: Byzantine robustness, differential privacy.
- **Index and Query Techniques**: Heavy hitter/histogram statistics, membership tests, Cuckoo hashing.

Feel free to reach out to me via email at [20102636r@connect.polyu.hk](mailto:20102636r@connect.polyu.hk) or connect for potential collaborations and opportunities.
